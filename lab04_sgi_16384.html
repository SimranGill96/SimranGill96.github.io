    <div class="col-d-3 col-t-3"><b>Mobile</b><br>The mobile format is most difficult to design
    because there are different screen sizes for different kinds of phones.<br>So one formatting is
     for smart phone while a 240x320px formatting has been added for small screen phones
      as some generation of phones have buttons which reduces the display area. <br>
    </div>
    <div class="col-d-4 col-t-4"><b>Tablets</b><br>Tablets are more of like small laptops or phones
     depending on their size,<br> while some tablets can have larger displays which adapt with
    rotation resulting in a desktop like display<br> so a base of 768px has been used in
    formatting so that screen is adjustable with rotation accordingly.
    </div>
    <div class="col-d-5 col-t-5"><b>Desktops</b><br>The dimensions for the display of a desktop screen
      usually depends on the website that is being used either in fullscreen mode or minimised view.<br>
      A minimun width of 992px has been used so that if website is used in either of the
     view the layout is adjustable according to the screen.This makes it adaptable to the 
       increase or decrease of the screen rather than leaving empty spaces on the screen.
